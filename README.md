Coding exercises from the Coursera Algorithms 1/2 series

Contents:
1) **Percolation**: using the concept of Union-Find to test for a connected path through a cartesian grid of points
2) **Deques** writing a Deque and a Randomized Queue data structure from scratch
3) **Collinear Points** using Comparators and sorting algorithms to find collinear points in a random set
4) **8 Puzzle** using a Priority Queue and the A* algorithm to solve a sliding-tile puzzle
5) **K-D Trees**  implementing a K-D tree from scratch, to look for 1-D and 2-D intersections of points and figures.
6) **WordNet** applying Breadth and Depth based searching to compare terms in the WordNet graph of nouns.
7) **SeamCarving**  using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path through an image to shrink it across one axis without affecting the main features.
8) **Graph Flow** application of max-flow and min-cut to evaluate which teams in a given league are still in contention.
9) **Boggle**  Using DFS and the Trie structure to find all scoring words in a Boggle board layout
10) **Burrows-Wheeler** implementing a circular suffix array and the Burrows-Wheeler transformation to create a highly compressible representation of a data stream.
